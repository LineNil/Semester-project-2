The primary focus is on creating the front-end application that interacts with an existing API handling auction functionality.

## Brief
The auction website aims to provide a platform where users can list items for bidding and participate in auctions by placing bids on items listed by other users. New users are given an initial credit of 1000, which they can use to bid on items or earn by selling their own items. While non-registered users can browse listings, only registered users have the privilege to place bids.

## API
All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project focuses on the front-end application.
Refer to the Noroff API documentation for details on the auction endpoints.
